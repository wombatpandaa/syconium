# syconium
syconium is a minimalist and scalable configuration utility for Linux. Written for a school project.

"syconium" is the inner fruit of the fig, which is pollinated by wasps of the agaonidae family.

<b>Usage</b>
Use syconate.sh (Linux bash script) to execute figs (configuration files). Each fig is made up of variables, which can be commented out to skip that part of the script. syconate does all the heavy lifting, so there's no need to edit it - it's designed to be as plug-and-play as possible once you have the configuration settings you want in a fig.
Two sample figs are included with very basic settings, one for a server computer and one for a personal computer. Edit these or use agaonid.sh to make a fig for your own needs. This whole repo is available for any use case under MIT license, I just ask for credit somewhere if you use a lot of it.
